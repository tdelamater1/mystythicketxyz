            <p>
              Hello and welcome to my tech blog. My name is Tyler, I'm a
              software developer of many years. One thing I wish I did better
              was to document my learning journey, and that is what this blog
              strives to rectify. I've been getting into the habit of taking better notes
              with Obsidian, and it is my plan to transfer some of my more interesting
              findings here. My interests are mostly in Enterprise sofware
              development, but I also enjoy linux and open source software as
              well. Cheers!
